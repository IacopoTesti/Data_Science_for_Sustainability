## Spatial Data Science for Sustainability : 
### Economic and Social Satisfaction of Young Italian Graduates

The phenomenon known as "brain drain" is a very sensitive and central theme in the socio-political discussion in Italy. This refers to the loss of qualified human capital and the simultaneous lack of brain circulation. As explained by the professor of Demography and Social Statistics of the Catholic University in Milan Alessandro Rosina, the phenomenon is entirely consistent with the development processes of this century. On one hand there is the possibility to travel with short time and limited costs, on the other the attitude of the new generations has also changed, more inclined to move, to interact and confront with different cultures and realities. Based on the socio-demographic context described above, this work tries to illustrate the level of economic and social satisfaction of young Italian graduates between 20 and 34 years of age, on the hypothesis that this may, to some extent, be associated with the brain drain phenomenon. The data considered are taken from the "Multi-purpose Survey on Families: Aspects of Daily Life", a sample survey proposed by ISTAT (since 1993 and carried out every year) intent on detecting fundamental information relating to the daily life of individuals and families.
